RSA Encryption and Decryption Calculator

Overview
This web application provides a user-friendly interface for performing RSA encryption and decryption calculations. RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is a widely-used public-key cryptographic algorithm that ensures secure data transmission over insecure networks.

Features
Encryption: Encrypt plaintext messages using the RSA algorithm.
Decryption: Decrypt ciphertext messages using the RSA algorithm.
Key Generation: Generate RSA key pairs for encryption and decryption.
Customizable Settings: Adjust encryption key size and other parameters.
User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive design for easy navigation and usage.
Usage
Encryption:
Enter the plaintext message in the input field.
Specify the encryption key (public key) or generate a new key pair.
Click the "Encrypt" button to generate the ciphertext.
Decryption:
Enter the ciphertext message in the input field.
Provide the decryption key (private key).
Click the "Decrypt" button to reveal the original plaintext message.
Key Generation:
Use the provided option to generate RSA key pairs.
Specify the desired key size and other parameters.
Key pairs will be generated securely for encryption and decryption.
